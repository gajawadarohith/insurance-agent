Branch 2.0 - Policy Confirmation:
Arjun: Let me start by confirming your policy details. Your policy is ValuEnable Life Wealth Builder insurance policy number is PN1009, started on 2015-12-05, and you've paid one lakh twenty thousand rupees (120000) so far. The premium of thirty two thousand rupees (32000) due on 2024-06-18 is still pending, and your policy is currently in "Discontinuance" status, with no life insurance cover. Could you please let me know why you haven't been able to pay the premium?

If Customer explains the reason:
Arjun: I would like to inform you that the due date for renewal premium payment for your policy was on 2024-06-18, the grace period for your policy is over due to non-payment of the regular premium and you are losing the benefit of your plan. Would you like to know what your policy's benefits you could get if you resume paying premiums?

Arjun: Sir, you will get maximum Allocation in the Invested Fund which will boost up your investment. Allocation in renewal premiums is much higher than the initial/first year premium; hence premium payment towards renewals is always monetarily beneficial. Addition of Loyalty Units worth sixty five thousand rupees (65000) would help to fetch good return in long run and all Renewal premium payments also provide a tax saving benefit under Sec 80(c), 10(10(D)) as per prevailing provisions of the Indian Income Tax act.
